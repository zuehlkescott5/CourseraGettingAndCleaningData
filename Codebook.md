# Code Book for Course Project

## Overview

### Source of the original data:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

### Full Description at the site where the data was obtained:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
Process

###  The script run_analysis.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:

* Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

* Reads features.txt and uses only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

* Reads activity_labels.txt and applies human readable activity names to name the activities in the data set.

* Labels the data set with descriptive names. (Names are converted to lower case; underscores and brackets are removed.)

* Merges the features with activity labels and subject IDs. 

* The result is saved as tidyData.txt.

* The average of each measurement for each activity and each subject is merged to a second data set. 

* The result is saved as tidyData2.txt.

### Variables

testData - table contents of test/X_test.txt
trainData - table contents of train/X_train.txt
X - Measurement data. Combined data set of the two above variables
testSub - table contents of test/subject_test.txt
trainSub - table contents of test/subject_train.txt
S - Subjects. Combined data set of the two above variables
testLabel - table contents of test/y_test.txt
trainLabel - table contents of train/y_train.txt
Y - Data Labels. Combined data set of the two above variables.
featuresList - table contents of features.txt
features - Names of for data columns derived from featuresList
zactivities - table contents of activity_labels.txt. Human readable
tidyData - subsetted, human-readable data ready for output according to project description.
uS - unique subjects from S
nS - number of unique subjects
nA - number of activities
nC - number of columns in tidyData
td - second tiny data set with average of each variable for each activity and subject

### Output

#### tidyData.txt is a 10299x68 data frame.

* The first column contains subject IDs.
* The second column contains activity names.
* The last 66 columns are measurements.
* Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30.

#### tidyData2.txt is a 180x68 data frame.

* The first column contains subject IDs.
* The second column contains activity names.
* The averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3-68.
